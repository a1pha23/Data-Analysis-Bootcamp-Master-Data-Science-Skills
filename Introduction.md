## Four Primary Categories of Data Analytics

1. **Descriptive Analytics**:  
   Answers the question **"What happened?"** by summarizing historical data. Reports on monthly revenue or sales trends are two examples.

2. **Diagnostic Analytics**:  
   Examines information to determine **"Why did it happen?"** It frequently entails locating abnormalities or correlations in the data.

3. **Predictive Analytics**:  
   Answers the question **"What might happen?"** by predicting future events using historical data. This covers methods such as demand forecasting and machine learning for sales.

4. **Prescriptive Analytics**:  
   Provides action recommendations by addressing the question, **"What should we do?"** Optimization and simulation are used to determine the best course of action, such as supply chain optimization or pricing strategies.

## Steps Commonly Followed in the Data Analytics Process

- **Establish Goals**:  
  Determine the issue or query that needs to be addressed and establish precise objectives for the analysis.

- **Data Collection**:  
  Compile pertinent information from a range of sources, including databases, surveys, and logs.

- **Data Cleaning**:  
  Process and clean the data by eliminating mistakes, duplicates, and unnecessary information to ensure accuracy.

- **Data Analysis**:  
  Examine patterns, trends, or connections in the data using statistical or machine learning methods.

- **Interpret and Report**:  
  Convert findings into practical suggestions and convey insights via reports or visualizations.
